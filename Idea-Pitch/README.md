# Trailblazers' Vault

“Your party’s loot, safely stashed.”

### About the project

Trailblazers’ Vault is built to solve the clutter and confusion that often come with managing items and loot in tabletop RPGs like D&D, especially when inventories are shared across multiple players or campaigns.

It’s designed for TTRPG players and game masters who want an easier, more organized way to track and share their party’s gear.

Trailblazers’ Vault offers a streamlined inventory system that lets users manage, sort, and customize their loot through a simple interactive drag-and-drop interface.

This project was born from our own experience as players and dungeon masters, seeking a simple way to organize and track game inventories.
